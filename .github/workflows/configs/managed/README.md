# Workflow configs

Some workflows might rely in configurations, and central configurations for them will be hosted here.

This folder hosts CI configurations that are synced centrally by the `.github` repository.
If you want to manage a configuration in your repository independently, copy it out into `.github/workflows/configs` and refactor the dependency in the workflow that relies on it.
