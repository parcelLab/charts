# Workflow templates

Workflows defined in this folder ar examples and they won't work unless copied to the `.github/workflows` folder.

Before copying it to the root workflows folder, make sure you replace all the
`$VARIABLE` entries with values relevant to your application, and to remove the `#` comments.
